# TODO

- Config
  - json file
  - pkg
  - configurable ports
  - configurable model

- Experiment more with MCP prompt and resource stuff
  - maybe resource could be useful for manifests?

- Figure out streaming
  - stream the response back and print it out on the screen

- Remove mcp_golang from the kubernetes_tool file
  - Make the mcp server just a server with mappers

- Clean up the repo structure

- Maybe look at implementing other cases of media later on
