# ISSUES

I have seen it respond like this from time to time:
```
The issue is in your volume configuration - the volume name is misspelled as `"nginx-volumne"` (missing an 'e') in the spec.volumes array, but the volumeMounts are correctly referencing `"nginx-volume"`.

Let me fix this for you:

<tool_call>
{"name": "run_kubectl_command", "arguments": {"command":"kubectl patch pod nginx-tester-6fd4fbc95c-htdjx -n default -p '{\"spec\":{\"volumes\":[{\"name\":\"nginx-volume\",\"persistentVolumeClaim\":{\"claimName\":\"nginx-pvc\"}}]}}'"}}
</tool_call>
```


I have also seen it respond like this:
```
The issue is that the container's command is set to `"hi"`, which is not a valid executable in the Nginx image. This is causing the container to fail during startup. To fix this, we need to update the container's command in the deployment to use the correct Nginx command.

Let's retrieve the deployment YAML to inspect and modify the container's command:

{
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "id": "get-deployment-yaml",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "run_kubectl_command",
        "arguments": {
          "command": "kubectl get deployment nginx-tester -o yaml"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
